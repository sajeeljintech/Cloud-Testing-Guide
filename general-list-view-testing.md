#### Reporting List View Bugs&#x20;

To report any bugs with testing general list view functionality, you will need to go to that module list. Each module list has a task for List View - see example below![](https://t8560266.p.clickup-attachments.com/t8560266/1e8cb74c-4228-4484-a765-51c9cd24ec34/image.png)To report a bug in the list view you will create a new subtask in the master task, and set the status to SGL QA - BUG REPORT![](https://t8560266.p.clickup-attachments.com/t8560266/139ee9b9-6128-4766-928a-a30f6a192916/image.png)![](https://t8560266.p.clickup-attachments.com/t8560266/87cda0d3-8f0a-4b67-8bc8-ca3fc5ca968d/image.png)
