# Introduction

### The Cloud&#x20;

As you know, ShowGroundsLive is excited to be moving to a cloud-based software, which means we are doing a ground-up rewrite of our existing software. You have been selected to assist with testing the new platform before we are releasing it into production. This Testing Guide has been created to assist you in navigating your way through the testing process, ensuring that you have all the information and resources you need to provide valuable feedback and insights. Your dedication and expertise as a tester play a pivotal role in helping us deliver a seamless and exceptional user experience

### Honest Feedback&#x20;

The SGL team has laid out certain parameters or items that do in fact need to be systematically tested, and we value honest feedback on our new platform highly. With ClickUp you will be able to provide your feedback in a constructive and organized way that we can use to strengthen the platform and elevate it to the next level. No detail is too small! We want all feedback, whether it be something more serious as a function not working at all, down to how you THINK a function should work. Yes, we work with the development of our platform on a regular basis, but you are the ones that use this on a day to day basis as a user. We will accept all forms of suggestions!&#x20;

### Disclosure&#x20;

Your participation in testing the next phase of our platform is crucial to its success, and we value your commitment. To ensure the confidentiality of our project and to protect the integrity of our work, we kindly ask that you keep any information you come across during testing strictly confidential. This includes not sharing any proprietary details or discussing the software's features and functionalities and your experience while testing with anyone outside of the testing group. Your cooperation in maintaining this confidentiality will help us create a better product for everyone. We're excited to embark on this journey with you and look forward to the valuable insights you'll provide.&#x20;

### Assignments

SGL staff will be assigning testers to specific tasks in ClickUp for testing. Once you have completed your assigned tasks for testing, you can ask SGL for additional assignments.&#x20;

#### How Assignments Work

Each tester will have their own personal dashboard.&#x20;

On each dashboard, there are four different "Cards" or sections. Each person will have an "Assigned to Test", "Assigned Testing in Progress", Retest Needed", and "Documentation Link for Directions and Additional Information".&#x20;

**Cards**

1. Assigned to Test
   1. This card will show each of the assigned tasks for that particular individual.&#x20;

   2. It is important to recognize that if you are assigned tasks from different modules, they will be separated by the module. For example, any tasks out of the shows module will show together, you must scroll down to see other tasks from different modules.&#x20;
2. Assigned Testing in Progress
   1. This card will show any assigned tasks that the tester is working on, but has not yet completed. These tasks will only show on this card if the tester has changed the status to QA-Change Approved, QA- In Progress, QA-Change Needed, QA- Bug Report.

3. Retest Needed
